        <h2 class="h2">About Growing Hands </h2>
        <p>
            Established in 2000, Growing Hands is the largest and most trusted giving platform in India today. Our community of 2M+ donors and 250+ corporate partners and brands have supported 2,200+ nonprofits, impacting 15M+ lives across India.
            A school engaged with children having special needs.
            This school is committed in their goals for providing children with
            customized support by designing curriculum and activities solely for
            the child. But the ultimate version lied in making these children
            independent. Thus the idea of “Let’s make dependent” was born.
            
            It was introduced to them to provide them a platform to give
            an opportunity to capitalize on the God’s gifts and talents in them.
            With the efforts of the team, we have now become hope of many such
            people with special needs who can now proof their worth. The hand
            painted shoe by them open the doors of financial freedom for such
            people.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Teaching the teacher is key</p>
        <h2 class="h2">Education of children</h2>
        <p>Building an effective education system for a world after Covid-19 needs to include a collaborative stakeholder engagement and customized solution for all target groups. It is pertinent to note the plethora of challenges that Covid-19 has brought to the fore since March 2020-- a digital divide, gender-digital divide, and quality of training. Even before Covid-19, India’s education sector was already trailing with an insufficient number of teachers, quality of teachers, an ecosystem for training teachers, setting the ground for a digital education model. Students were at the receiving end of these sectoral issues.

            For educators across the world, the pandemic has been a quintessential adaptive and transformative challenge, a challenge with no predefined guide, but in the Indian context, the trouble is deep-rooted in the lack of innovative digital infrastructure for connecting students, teachers, parents, and institutions on a single platform. While there is an immense focus to find a solution on one end--students--there is less emphasis on teaching the teachers.
            
            Dialling it back a step, the infrastructure for education, sufficient budgetary allocation and quality of education and pupil-teacher ratio (30:1) were key issues of the sector. These resulted in warped primary education which created a domino effect for high education, students coming out of the higher education system also lacked the desired technical and managerial competency and skills and are often found unemployable.
            
            A study by Growing Hands showed that 43.99% of surveyed children had access to smartphones and another 43.99% of students had access to basic phones while 12.02% do not have access to either smartphones or basic phones. A total of 56.01% of children were found to have no access to smartphones, the study said. 
            
            There is no such study or assessment on teachers' understanding of online education, online examination and online evaluation. This again needs to be looked at with various sub lenses--the urban-rural, socio-economic and gendered lens. The teachers are also new to the pandemic. They have no prior manual to function in this new world order. There are two ways to map the gap, a feedback study by parents or an online evaluation check for teachers. Either route will help the education sector define the problem.
